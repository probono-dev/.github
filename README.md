# Config Repository

Cofigurations for all repositories (e.g.: ProBot config).

## Purpose

Development tools like ProBot enable you to use a central repository to manage configuration files. This is usually undocumented in the specific bots' descriptions, but a good way to find bots that do is to look at [the config parser's NPM Dependents](https://www.npmjs.com/package/probot-config).

### Bots that support global configuration:

- [Move Bot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/move-issues)
- [Release Drafter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/release-drafter-github-app)
- [Request Info Bot](https://github.com/behaviorbot/request-info)
- [Stale Bot](https://github.com/probot/stale)
